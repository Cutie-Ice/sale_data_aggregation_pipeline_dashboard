## 🚀 The Problem
Retail businesses often struggle with unstable internet connections, leading to data gaps and operational downtime. Traditional cloud-only dashboards fail when the network goes down.

## 💡 The Solution     
**Sales Intelligence Hub** bridges the gap. It operates locally for 100% uptime and seamlessly syncs to the cloud when connectivity returns. It's the best of both worlds: the reliability of desktop software with the accessibility of the cloud.
